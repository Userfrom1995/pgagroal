# Vault

## Enable rotation of passwords

In the main configuration file of [**pgagroal**][pgagroal] add the following configuration for rotating frontend passwords and make sure management port is enabled in the [**pgagroal**][pgagroal] section of the configuration file.

```
management = 2347
rotate_frontend_password_timeout = 60
rotate_frontend_password_length = 12
```

## Configuration

In order to run `pgagroal-vault`, you need to configure the vault `pgagroal_vault.conf` configuration file, that will tell the vault how to work, which address to listen, address of management service in [**pgagroal**][pgagroal] so on,
and then `pgagroal_vault_users.conf` that will instrument the vault about the admin username and password of the remote management.

**pgagroal-vault.conf**

It is now time to create the main `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_vault.conf` configration file, with your editor of choice or using `cat` from the command line, create the following content:

```
cd /etc/pgagroal
cat > pgagroal_vault.conf
[pgagroal-vault]
host = localhost
port = 2500

metrics = 2501

ev_backend = auto

log_type = console
log_level = info
log_path = /tmp/pgagroal-vault.log

[main]
host = localhost
port = 2347
user = admin
```

and press `Ctrl-d` (if running `cat`) to save the file.

**Add users file**

As the [**pgagroal**][pgagroal] operating system user, run the following command:

```
pgagroal-admin -f /etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_vault_users.conf -U admin -P admin1234 user add
```

The above will create the `admin` username with the `admin1234` password. Alternately, `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_admins.conf` can be provided for vault users information.

See [the documentation about `pgagroal_vault.conf` for more details](https://github.com/agroal/pgagroal/blob/master/doc/VAULT.md).

## Start the vault

It is now time to start `pgagroal-vault`, so as the [**pgagroal**][pgagroal] operating system user run:

```
pgagroal-vault -d
```

If both `pgagroal` and `pgagroal-vault` are on the same operating system they can use the same `pgagroal_admins.conf` file.

This command initializes an HTTP server on localhost port 2500, which is primed to exclusively handle GET requests from clients.

## Connect to the vault

Since we have deployed an HTTP server we can simply use `curl` to send GET requests

**Correct requests**

If the requested URL is of form `http://<hostname>:<port>/users/<frontend_user>` such that `<frontend_user>` exists, the server will return a header response with a 200 status code and the frontend password corresponding to the `<frontend_user>` in the response body.

**Example**

`
curl -i http://localhost:2500/users/myuser
`

Output

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain


password
```

**Incorrect requests**

All the POST requests will be ignored and the server will send a `HTTP 404 ERROR` as a response.

Any URL other than the format: `http://<hostname>:<port>/users/*` will result in `HTTP 404 ERROR`.

**Example**

`
curl -i http://localhost:2500/user
`

Output

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

```

A URL of form `http://<hostname>:<port>/users/<frontend_user>` such that `<frontend_user>` does not exist will also give `HTTP 404 ERROR`.

**Example**

`
curl -i http://localhost:2500/users/randomuser
`

Output

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found

```

## Monitor the vault

**Status endpoint**

The vault provides a status endpoint for health monitoring and operational visibility:

```
curl http://localhost:2500/status
```

This endpoint:
* Requires no authentication
* Returns JSON with vault status information
* Tests pgagroal connection in real-time
* Shows configuration details
* Available over both HTTP and HTTPS

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-08T10:30:45Z",
  "vault": {
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "pid": 12345
  },
  "configuration": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 2500,
    "tls_enabled": false,
    "metrics_port": 2501,
    "metrics_tls_enabled": false
  },
  "pgagroal_connection": {
    "status": "connected",
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 2347
  }
}
```

## Transport Level Security (TLS)

**Enable TLS**

It is now time to modify the `[pgagroal-vault]` section of configuration file `/etc/pgagroal/pgagroal_vault.conf` with your editor of choice by adding the following lines in the [pgagroal-vault] section.

```
tls = on
tls_cert_file = </path/to/server.crt>
tls_key_file = </path/to/server.key>
```

This will add TLS support to the server alongside the standard `http` endpoint, allowing clients to make requests to either the `https` or `http` endpoint.

**Only Server Authentication**

If you wish to do only server authentication the aforementioned configuration suffice.

**Client Request**

```
curl --cacert </path/to/server_root_ca.crt> -i https://localhost:2500/users/<frontend_user>
```

**Full Client and Server Authentication**

To enable the server to request the client certificates add the following configuration lines

```
tls = on
tls_cert_file = </path/to/server.crt>
tls_key_file = </path/to/server.key>
tls_ca_file = </path/to/client_root_ca.crt>
```

**Client Request**

```
curl --cert </path/to/client.crt> --key </path/to/client.key> --cacert </path/to/server_root_ca.crt> -i https://localhost:2500/users/<frontend_user>
```

**Certificate Authentication Modes**

When `tls_ca_file` is configured, the vault supports two certificate authentication modes controlled by the `tls_cert_auth_mode` setting:

**verify-ca (default)**: The vault verifies that the client certificate is signed by a trusted CA. This is the default mode and provides a balance between security and ease of use.

```
tls = on
tls_cert_file = </path/to/server.crt>
tls_key_file = </path/to/server.key>
tls_ca_file = </path/to/client_root_ca.crt>
tls_cert_auth_mode = verify-ca
```

**verify-full**: In addition to CA verification, the vault also verifies that the certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) or Common Name (CN) matches the username being accessed. This provides the highest level of security by ensuring certificate ownership.

```
tls = on
tls_cert_file = </path/to/server.crt>
tls_key_file = </path/to/server.key>
tls_ca_file = </path/to/client_root_ca.crt>
tls_cert_auth_mode = verify-full
```

With `verify-full` mode enabled, if a client attempts to access `/users/alice`, the client certificate must contain "alice" in the SAN extension or in the CN field (if no SAN exists).

**Certificate Identity Priority**

When using `verify-full` mode, the vault extracts the username from the client certificate using this priority:

1. **Subject Alternative Name (SAN)** - Checked first. The vault examines DNS, Email, then URI types in order and uses the first valid value found (non-empty, no null bytes).
2. **Common Name (CN)** - Only checked if no SAN extension exists, or no valid SAN value is found.

**Important:** CN is **completely ignored** if any valid SAN value exists in the certificate, even if the SAN value doesn't match the requested username.

**How identity extraction works:**
1. Check SAN extension: If present, examine DNS type first, then Email, then URI
2. Use the first valid SAN value found and stop (remaining SANs and CN are ignored)
3. If no SAN extension exists or no valid SAN values, check CN as fallback
4. The extracted identity is then compared (case-sensitive) against the requested username

**Recommendation:** For simplicity, use `CN=username` with no SAN entries, or a SAN entry with a single DNS value.

Example certificate with CN only:
```bash
openssl req -new -key user.key -out user.csr -subj "/CN=alice"
```

**Examples:**
```
Certificate: CN=alice (no SAN extension)
Access: /users/alice => Success (CN used)

Certificate: SAN DNS=alice
Access: /users/alice => Success (SAN DNS used, CN ignored)

Certificate: SAN DNS=alice, CN=bob
Access: /users/alice => Success (SAN used, CN completely ignored)
Access: /users/bob => Fails (CN ignored when SAN present)

```
